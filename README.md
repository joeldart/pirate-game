This was a port of an opengl project I did back in college for my graphics class. Html5 canvas 
was being announced and I wanted to learn JavaScript (as you can see from "new Array(9)" in the
code, le sigh) so I translated the project over. I kept it as a single file so I could share it
with my friends without a server and basically just hacked on it till I got it working then stopped.

On the infinite time list was to rewrite it and optimize for performance on ios. At the time, it was
unplayably slow on ios which had just gotten canvas support. I had planned for some memoization 
and other tricks but got distracted by something else shiny and dropped it.
